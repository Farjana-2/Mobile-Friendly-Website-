 Website Mobile-Friendly Using CSS Media Queries.

## 🌐 Project Title
**Responsive Portfolio Website**

## ✅ Objective
To make my existing desktop-only portfolio mobile-friendly using CSS **media queries** and responsive design techniques.

## 🔧 What I Did
- Implemented responsive layout for all sections (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- Used media queries targeting devices with `max-width: 768px`
- Stacked nav items vertically on smaller screens
- Adjusted padding, font sizes, and layout for better mobile usability
- Ensured all sections are centered and fluid on different viewports

## 🛠 Steps Followed (as per Task Guide)

1. ✅ **Opened the HTML page in VS Code**  
   Used my personal portfolio page as the base layout.

2. ✅ **Identified fixed width elements or large images**  
   Adjusted fixed containers like `.content-box`, `.section`, and `.nav`.

3. ✅ **Wrote media queries targeting `max-width: 768px`**  
   All layout changes were wrapped in media queries to ensure responsiveness on small screens.

4. ✅ **Adjusted layout: stacked columns vertically and reduced font sizes**  
   Ensured sections are vertically aligned and typography is easily readable on phones.

5. ✅ **Made nav menu collapse or stack vertically**  
   Navigation items now stack and center on smaller viewports.

6. ✅ **Tested with Chrome DevTools device toolbar**  
   Verified appearance across multiple mobile screen sizes using Edge DevTools.

7. ✅ **Fixed overflow and scrolling issues**  
   Removed any horizontal scroll issues and ensured smooth mobile layout flow.

8. ✅ **Ensured images scale within containers**  
   While there were no large images, containers and icons scale responsively.
